    "## ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The images in this section are from Provost, Foster; Fawcett, Tom (2013-07-27). Data Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking  O'Reilly Media. Great book!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can check on the thresholds we talked about in the previous section and compare our classifiers to each other and the baseline models using the ROC curves you learned about in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that ROC curves are actually a set of classifiers, in which we move the threshold for classifying a sample as positive from 1 to 0. Each point on a ROC curve is a separate classifier obtained by considering a different threshold. (In the standard scenario, where we used the  classifier accuracy, this threshold is implicitly set at 0.5, and we have only one classifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "![m:roc curve](images/roc-curve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The way ROC curves are calulated is this. We start with a large threshold, something like 0.99 or so. This means that only samples with a probability of being positive higher than that threshold are classified as positive. That is the really really really positive ones! The idea then is to decrease this threshold, such that more and more samples get classified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "![howto roc](images/howtoroc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical way to do this is to order the samples by probability of being positive, or in the case of the SVM, by the `decision_function` or distance from the separating hyperplane. Then consider the sample with the highest score or highest probability of being positive. At first, only this sample is positive. Then, we take the sample with the next highest score, and call it positive. As we go down the list, we go down a threshold in score or probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each such situation: only 1 positive, now 2 positive,....you can imagine a different classifier with a different confusion matrix. It will have its own false positives, tre positives, etc. Its actually the same original classifier, but with a different threshold each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we keep going down the list, decreasing the threshold, more and more samples become positive, and at first, the true positives rise faster than the false positives. Once past a certain point, false positives increase faster than true positives. Now, if you want a balanced classifier, you look at this turn-around point...the northwest corner, so to speak. But if you want a classifier which penalizes false positives and false negatives differently, the point you want is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the confusion matrix again:\n",
    "\n",
    "![hwimages](./images/confusionmatrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a ROC curve you plot the True Positive Rate, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$TPR=\\frac{TP}{OP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "against the False Positive Rate,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$FPR=\\frac{FP}{ON}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as you go through this process of going down the list of samples. ROC curves are useful because they calculate one classifier per threshold and show you where you are in TPR/FPR space without making any assumptions about the utility matrix or which threshold is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the ROC curve has a very interesting property: if you look at the confusion matrix above, TPR is only calculated from the observed \"1\" row while FPR is calculated from the observed '0' row. This means that the ROC curve is independent of the class balance/imbalance on the test set, and thus works for all ratios of positive to negative samples. The balance picks a point on the curve, as you can read below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rote reading of the ROC curve (go to the \"northwest\" corner) is a bad idea: you must fold in the curve with any assumptions you are making about costs. More on this in the next lab. Still, on the whole, a curve with a greater AUC (area under curve), or further away from the line of randomness, will give us a rough idea of what might be a better classifier.\n"
